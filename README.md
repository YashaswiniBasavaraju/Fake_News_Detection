# Fake_News_Detection
(WELFake) dataset of 72,134 news articles with 35,028 real and 37,106 fake news. For this, we merged four popular news datasets (i.e. Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political) to prevent over-fitting of classifiers and to provide more text data for better ML training.

Dataset contains four columns: Serial number (starting from 0)

 Title (about the text news heading)
 
 Text (about the news content)
 
 Label (0 = fake and 1 = real).

There are 78098 data entries in csv file out of which only 72134 entries are accessed as per the data frame.

This Dataset has been downloaded from IEEE XPLore
